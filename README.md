Overview
The Morse Code Translator is an Arduino-based project that converts text into Morse code using LEDs and a buzzer. This project helps in understanding "Morse code encoding and real-time signal transmission". Built using Tinkercad, it visually and audibly represents Morse signals.

Features
Text-to-Morse Conversion – Converts letters, numbers, and symbols into Morse code.  
LED & Buzzer Output – Blinks LED and beeps a buzzer for Morse signals.  
Adjustable Speed – Modify Morse transmission speed using `dotTime`.  
Multiple LEDs – Different colors for dots and dashes.  
Tinkercad Simulation – Fully designed in Tinkercad.  

Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- LEDs (Red & Green)  
- Buzzer 
- Resistors  
- Push Button(optional for input)  
- Connecting Wires  

How It Works
1. Enter text into the Arduino serial monitor (or predefine a message).  
2. The LED blinks & buzzer beeps in Morse code.  
3. The speed can be adjusted by changing `dotTime`.  
4. Supports English letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and common symbols.
